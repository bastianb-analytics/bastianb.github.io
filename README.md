# Bastian B — Data Analytics Portfolio

Mathematician with a focus on data analysis.  
I work on problems such as fraud detection, risk analysis, statistical bias,
and feature-driven explanations. My work emphasizes interpretability,
statistical rigor, and predictive modeling.

I build machine learning models not only to predict outcomes,
but to understand the drivers behind the data and their real-world impact.
